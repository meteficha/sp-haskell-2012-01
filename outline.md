# About this presentation

* Just an overview:
    * Yesod features,
    * Yesod ecosystem, and
    * Blog example (if time allows)
* Based on Michael Snoyman's QCon 2011 presentation.
* Homework:
    * Go to <http://www.yesodweb.com/>.
    * Read the Yesod book!

# Yesod features

# Type-safe routes

* Routes are represented by data types.

        !haskell
        /             RootR     GET
        /blog/#BlogId BlogPostR GET

* Typos are caught in compile time.

        Not in scope: data constructor `BlogPsotR'
        Perhaps you meant `BlogPostR'

* Parsing and rendering always in sync: no broken links, ever!

---

# Compile-time templates

* Called "Shakespearean templates".

* Syntax checked at compile time.

* Only type-safe Haskell values used.

* Supports:
    * HTML (Hamlet),
    * CSS (Cassius, Lucius),
    * JavaScript (Julius, CoffeeScript, Roy).

---

# XSS protection

* Text within your app is your text, always.

* App boundaries are correctly treated, automatically, always.

    * Templates (interpolation),

    * Routes (parsing and rendering),

    * Forms (decoding and encoding),

    * Database queries (decoding and encoding).

* You never directly call any (un)escaping function.

* An entire class of bugs is eliminated!

---

# Persistent

* Declare entity definitions in a DSL (domain specific language).

        !haskell
        Person
          name String
          age Int Maybe
        BlogPost
          title String
          authorId PersonId

* Generates data types, marshalling functions, schemas.

* Automatic schema migration.

* SQL backends: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite.

* NoSQL backends: MongoDB.

---

# Persistent

* Example:

        !haskell
        johnId <- insert $ Person "John Doe" (Just 35)
        janeId <- insert $ Person "Jane Doe" Nothing
        insert $ BlogPost "My fr1st p0st" johnId
        insert $ BlogPost "One more for good measure" johnId
        oneJohnPost <- selectList [BlogPostAuthorId ==. johnId] [LimitTo 1]
        liftIO $ print (oneJohnPost :: [(BlogPostId, BlogPost)])
        john <- get johnId
        liftIO $ print (john :: Maybe Person)
        delete janeId
        deleteWhere [BlogPostAuthorId ==. johnId]

---

# Esqueleto

* Type checked embedded DSL for SQL queries.

* Built on top of persistent.

* Supports very complex queries.  For example:

    * SQL:

            !sql
            SELECT BlogPost.*, Person.*
            FROM BlogPost, Person
            WHERE BlogPost.authorId = Person.id
            ORDER BY BlogPost.title ASC

    * Haskell using esqueleto:

            !haskell
            select $
            from $ \(b, p) -> do
            where_ (b ^. BlogPostAuthorId ==. p ^. PersonId)
            orderBy [asc (b ^. BlogPostTitle)]
            return (b, p)


---

# Esqueleto

* Queries are composable!

        !haskell
        blogPostsFrom personId =
          from $ \post -> do
          where_ (post ^. BlogPostAuthorId ==. personId)
          return post

        bloggers =
          from $ \person -> do
          where_ $ exists $ void $ blogPostsFrom (person ^. PersonId)
          return person


---

# Widgets

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Haskell code in a single bundle.

* Affects both <body> and <head> (CSS and JS are concatenated in
  into a single, minified file).

* Example:

        !haskell
        footer = do
            toWidget [lucius|
              footer {
                font-weight: bold; text-align: center
              }
            |]
            toWidget [hamlet|
              <footer>
                <p>That's all folks!
            |]

* Templates could be in another file.

* There could be any I/O actions, such as database queries.

---

# Others

* Type-safe I18n via messages as data types.

* Subsites, may define their own subroutes.

* Authentication with many ready-to-use plugins (e-mail, Google, Facebook...).

* Server middlewares (logging, gzip, JSON-P...).

* Automatic deployment via keter.

* And much more!

---

# Yesod ecosystem

---

# Team

* Yesod was created by Michael Snoyman but currently is a work of
  many people.

* About a dozen people have commit access to Yesod repos right now.

* Many other contributors without commit access (yet!).

* Very friendly community, come join us =).

(Data from January 23rd, 2013.)

---

# Libraries

* The Yesod Team maintains a lot of libraries, many of which are
  not Yesod-specific and are used elsewhere.

* Some tracks of libraries:

    * Persistent: core, mysql, postgresql, sqlite, mongoDB.

    * Yesod: core, auth (+ plugins), form, persistent, json, default, platform.

    * Shakespeare: core, css, js, text, hamlet.

    * Conduit: core, attoparsec, base64, blaze-builder, crypto,
    http, network, pool, xml, zlib.

    * WAI: wai, wai-app-static, wai-extra, warp, warp-tls.

    * Others: cookie, clientsession, esqueleto, keter...

* However, none of these libraries would exist without the
  awesome ecosystem that has been flourishing on the Haskell land!
